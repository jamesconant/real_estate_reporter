# Assumptions
# 1. Agent can only belong to one brokerage at a time.
# 2. Each sale has exactly one agent.
# 3. Each sale has at most one review and property.
# 4. Pulling the report is more frequent than importing files. (hence caching)
# 5. Sales and ratings aggregations follow the agent, not the brokerage.
